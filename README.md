### About Me
I am a versatile Software Engineer with over 7 years of experience in solving complex problems and building robust, scalable applications. My journey in software development encompasses both front-end and back-end technologies, making me a well-rounded engineer capable of tackling diverse challenges.

### Skills

TypeScript, Node.js, Express, React, Vue, Angular, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

### What I Do
- **Full-Stack Development**: Proficient in creating rich user interfaces and interactive web applications using JavaScript/TypeScript and modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. My expertise extends to HTML and CSS semantics, along with meta-frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt.js, enables me to deliver immersive user experiences. On the back-end, I work with Express, Node.js, Docker, and Kubernetes, applying my analytical skills to optimize performance and ensure reliability.

- **Program Analysis**: Working on software composition analysis scanners and building scalable solutions to address complex problems within the open-source ecosystem.

- **System Design & Architecture:** As a technical lead, I have driven successful architecture projects, implemented design systems, and created component libraries. My emphasis on clean, modular, and loosely coupled code promotes flexible and maintainable software architectures.

- **DevOps & Continuous Integration:** With a DevOps mindset, I have enhanced continuous integration pipelines using platforms such as GitHub Actions, CircleCI, and Jenkins. Streamlining development processes has enabled faster delivery cycles without compromising code quality.

- **Test Automation:** I advocate for robust QA processes and have implemented effective testing strategies using tools like Jest/Vitest, Cypress/Playwright, Storybook, and Percy/Chromatic. My goal is to ensure the delivery of reliable, bug-free software.

### My Approach
I believe in fostering a healthy team culture that values collaboration, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement. By promoting clean code practices and identifying suitable design patterns, I empower teams to build scalable, robust, and maintainable software.

I stay on top of the latest trends and tools to adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My diverse skill set and ability to navigate both front-end and back-end challenges make me a well-rounded engineer capable of delivering high-quality solutions across the stack.
