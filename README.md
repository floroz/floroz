## I build things with JavaScript 

I am a Software Engineer who is passionate about creating rich user interfaces and interactive web applications, translating interaction designs and product concepts into an immersive experience for the end-users.

I love solving problems and creating flexible and maintainable software architectures, which reflect SOLID principles and implement fitting design patterns.

Through mentoring, pair programming, and code reviews, I contribute to building a healthy team culture that highlights the importance of writing clean, modular, and loosely coupled code that is easy to extend, maintain and reuse.

I am an advocate for web accessibility and inclusiveness, and I try to write software that is usable (and enjoyable) by large audiences with different needs and skillsets.
