## I build things with JavaScript 

I am a highly skilled Software Engineer with a passion for creating rich user interfaces and interactive web applications. With a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and inclusiveness, I specialize in translating interaction designs and product concepts into immersive experiences for end-users.

As a team player and mentor, I am committed to building a healthy team culture that values clean, modular, and loosely coupled code. I excel at solving problems, crafting flexible and maintainable software architectures, and implementing SOLID principles and design patterns.

In my commercial experience, I have worked with a broad range of technologies and frameworks, including HTML & CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Next.js, Angular, Node.js, Express, GraphQL, Apollo, and PHP.
